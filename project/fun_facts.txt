Sunspots are actually fairly bright, but they appear dark because the rest of the Sun is so much brighter.
Sunspots often appear in pairs.
Sunspots were observed as far back as 364 BC by astronomers in Ancient China.
The photosphere has a temperature of 5,800 degrees, Kelvin and Sunspots have temperatures of about 3,800 degrees Kelvin.
Sunspots are caused by strong magnetic activity within the Sun.
A sunspot's diameter can range up to 50,000 kilometers.
The lighter outer section of a sunspot is known as the penumbra.
The dark middle section of a sunspot is known as the umbra.
A sunspot is not permanent. It can last from days to weeks to months and can also travel across the solar disk.
Sunspots were telescopically observed in 1610 AD for the first time by Thomas Harriott, Johannes and David Fabricus.
A typical sunspot cycle lasts for 11 years. After every 11 years, their number increase and then starts reducing.
In 1890 while looking at the historical records, E. Maunder noticed that the number fell drastically between 1645 and 1715.
When two more sunspots are gathered in a region, it is known as a sunspot group or the Active Region.
These spots may be several times larger than Earth or so small that telescopic observation is difficult.
